Social Media Base is a fullstack social networking platform that I am currently building as a long term learning and development project. The goal of this application is to explore and implement modern web development practices while creating a functional and scalable social media experience.
The platform begins with a secure and streamlined authentication flow. 
Users can log in using valid credentials, and once authenticated, they are redirected to the Home page. 
From there, they can either register new users or access a personalized feed displaying posts from the community. 
As the project evolves, additional social features will be introduced to make the experience more dynamic and interactive.
The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, 
structured following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architectural pattern to maintain code clarity, separation of concerns, and scalability. 
It implements a complete CRUD REST API, handling user data and post interactions efficiently. 
For authentication, the backend utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) to generate and verify secure tokens, while bcrypt is used to hash passwords, ensuring strong security practices for user credentials.
On the frontend, the application is built with Next.js and TypeScript, taking advantage of server-side rendering, modern routing, and strong type safety. 
The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, allowing for a clean, responsive, and highly customizable design system that keeps the interface modern and user-friendly.
Working on Social Media Base has been an incredibly valuable experience. 
Throughout the development process, 
I have deepened my understanding of full-stack architecture, authentication flows, API design, security best practices, and modern frontend frameworks. 
I plan to continue expanding and refining this project, adding new features, improving performance, and enhancing the overall user experience as I grow as a developer.
